  <!-- In short, the web.xml is a file that describes how your application should be deployed
  	We call this file the "deployment descriptor"; though we happen to name the file "web.xml".
  	
  	This file will be used to describe to tomcat HOW to deploy your project. So in a way, it's like
  	tomcat's config file for YOUR project (turns out tomcat could have more than one project deployed on it, each
  	with their own web.xml file)
